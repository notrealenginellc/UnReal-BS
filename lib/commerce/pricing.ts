// What UnReal Systems keeps when somebody sells a digital product here.
//
// This module is imported by BOTH the seller's editor (which quotes the payout
// before they publish) and the checkout route (which writes the split into the
// order row). One function, one answer — the number a seller was promised and
// the number the database moves cannot drift apart. Same discipline as
// lib/meta/service-fee.ts.
//
// SHAPE: 10% of the sale price, with a floor and a cap.
//
//   10%      Gumroad charges a flat 10%; Teachable takes 5% plus payment fees
//   commission on top. Sitting at 10% while ALSO doing the payment collection by hand
//            is defensible to a seller who shops around, and it scales with what
//            they actually earn rather than charging them to exist.
//
//   floor    every order costs the same to process: read the bKash TrxID,
//   ৳10      match it, confirm, answer the buyer if it goes wrong. On a ৳100
//            product 10% is ৳10 anyway, so the floor only binds below ৳100 and
//            never turns into a surprise.
//
//   cap      above ~৳20,000 a straight percentage stops tracking any work we
//   ৳2,000   do and starts reading as a tax on success. A ৳50,000 course pays
//            ৳2,000, not ৳5,000. Keeps the sellers worth keeping.
//
//   minimum  below ৳50 the commission is most of the price and a manual bKash
//   ৳50      confirmation costs more attention than the sale is worth. Free
//   price    products (৳0) are exempt and fully supported — see below.
//
// FREE PRODUCTS EARN NOTHING, ON PURPOSE. A free ebook that turns a stranger
// into a tagged contact in the seller's GHL sub-account is the most useful
// thing a small Bangladeshi seller can publish, and charging commission on
// zero would just mean nobody ships one.
//
// Everything here is pure and unit-tested in pricing.test.ts.
